# Socratic Walls

A wallpaper generator by taking snapshots of mandelbrot set (and more in future like julia set or corals using collatz conjecture), and coloring them using some algorithms

## Why? Aren't there a thousand others?

Well that's correct, but all of them lacked in certain areas, so built this because:

- I could not find one which would randomly pick a location which would also be interesting (not just a black spot)
- Most of them used simple coloring algorithms
- Graphics are fun ;)

## Getting it running:
In a terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/codelif/socratic-walls
cd socratic-walls
go run ./cmd/backend
```
you can view the index.html in the browser, or run a local web server `python -m http.server`
