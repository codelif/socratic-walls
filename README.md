# Socratic Walls

A wallpaper generator by taking snapshots of mandelbrot set (and more in future like julia set or corals using collatz conjecture), and coloring them using some algorithms

## Why? Aren't there a thousand others?

Well that's correct, but I feel all of them lacked in certain areas, so I build this because:

- I could not find one which would randomly pick a location which would also be interesting
- Most of them used simple coloring algorithms
- Graphics are fun ;)
